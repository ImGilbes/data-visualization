## Important files

choropleth map **templates** (px + geopandas) are in **choropleths**

as generic graph/ infographic template use -> _dat_plot_ + old exams (check plot census)

**Theory questions** has full dimensionality reduction questions **templates** to copy paste

**dim_red_examples** has the best **templates** for dimensionality reduction exercises and has some example datasets that can be used to create example graphs -> PCA is not good on this dataset because... or t-SNE is better in this case because... 

numpy_and_matplotlib_notes, Pandas_seaborn_notes can be useful for sum stuff, but you'd rather just google those things (it's quicker)

## Plot Census: where to find what

**exam_08Feb21** -> chord, good detailed umap, italy, italian, local region choropleth map, diverging bars


bivariate choropleth, joint distribution with scatter plot -> **Exam_11Jan21**


**dat_plot** -> sns scatter with regression line, sankey, best sns guide 


tsne, umap, mds, pca, world map choropleth with points scattered, world map plot latitude and longitude -> **exam09Sep22_IMPORTANT**

world map choroplet colored per nation, pie chart, concentric pie / concentric donut -> **exam14Feb22**

bivariate choropleth, regional bivariate choropleth continuos/ discrete + scale ticks customization, Map of a random state, using external geojson -> **choropleths**


exam_23-6-23_gianluca_sassetti -> radar plot
